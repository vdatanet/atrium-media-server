# Architecture decision records

One decision per file, numbered, dated, and immutable once accepted. A decision that turns out to
be wrong is not edited — it is **superseded** by a new record that says so, and the old one gets a
`Superseded by` line. The history of what we believed and why is part of the documentation.

Format: context → decision → consequences → alternatives rejected. The alternatives section is not
optional; a decision without visible alternatives is a preference.
