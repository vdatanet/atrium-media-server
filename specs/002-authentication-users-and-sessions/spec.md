title: Authentication, users and sessions
status: Implemented
created: 2026-08-26
updated: 2026-09-01
accepted: 2026-08-26
amended: 2026-08-26 by the T1 probe - sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, AC-2, AC-3 and the open questions; by T7 - sections 2, 3.1, 3.2, AC-3 and section 6; by T11 - sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and AC-6; by T12 - section 3.8; by T18 - AC-3 and AC-10. 2026-08-28 by the L2 probe fold - section 3.8: an unknown capabilities property is dropped from the session's echo, not kept. 2026-09-01 by tools/probe_user_read.py - section 3.7, AC-7 and the section 6 matrix: GET /Users/{userId} refuses no authenticated caller, the 403 it stated with no provenance is withdrawn, and the two identifiers that name nobody are a 404 and a 400 rather than that same refusal; and 2026-09-01 at the closing audit - OQ-5 is narrowed to the three refusals still unmeasurable without costing somebody's account a lockout counter. It also held the `403` for insufficient permission and the shape of both `403`s, on the premise that the only account available to measure with is an administrator; three probes now create throwaway non-administrators, and 009 T2 measured both shapes, so that half was a debt the table was still reporting after it had been paid

# 002 — Authentication, users and sessions

> **This document describes WHAT and WHY only.** No technology names, no storage decisions.

## 1. Purpose

Turn a username and a password into a token, recognise that token on every later request, and know
which device is holding it.

Everything after this feature is user-scoped: an item's `UserData`, a library's visibility, a resume
position. None of it can be specified until "who is asking" has an answer.

**Client behaviour unlocked:** a login screen that works, and a session that survives the app being
closed.

## 2. Scope

**In scope**

- `POST /Users/AuthenticateByName`, `GET /Users/Public`, `GET /Users/Me`, `GET /Users/{userId}`,
  `POST /Users/Configuration`, `POST /Sessions/Capabilities/Full`, `GET /Sessions`.
- The five token-presentation mechanisms, on every authenticated route in the project.
- The client-identification header, and the device identity it establishes.
- User accounts, their configuration and the parts of their policy v1 honours.
- Session lifecycle: creation, activity tracking, expiry.

**Out of scope**

- Creating, editing and deleting users over HTTP (`POST /Users/New`, `/Users/Password`,
  `/Users/{userId}/Policy`). v1 manages accounts through configuration, not an admin API.
- Quick Connect, forgotten-password flows, external authentication providers.
- Remote control of one session by another; `GET /Sessions` reports, it does not command.
- API keys not belonging to a user.

## 3. Behaviour

### 3.1 How a client presents a token

**Five** mechanisms, all accepted, on **every** authenticated route:

| Mechanism | Form |
|---|---|
| Header | `Authorization: MediaBrowser Token="{token}"` |
| Header | `X-Emby-Authorization: MediaBrowser Token="{token}"` |
| Header | `X-Emby-Token: {token}` |
| Query | `?ApiKey={token}` |
| Query | `?api_key={token}` |

Listed in the order the reference resolves them. **The second was missing from this specification
until it was measured** `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` — the reference reads both header names with the same
grammar of §3.2, and a token in either authenticates. It is the historical Emby form, so a server
implementing only the other four would refuse clients that have worked against the reference for
years. Either header may carry the client's identification and the token together, which is what
most clients send.

`[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]`

All five are required, not a choice. Clients use headers for API calls and the query forms for URLs
handed to media players and image loaders, which do not set headers. Supporting only the headers
breaks playback and artwork while leaving browsing intact — a failure that looks like a bug in the
client.

**When a request carries two that disagree, the one that wins is measured, not chosen:**

    Authorization  >  X-Emby-Authorization  >  X-Emby-Token  >  ?ApiKey= / ?api_key=

measured pair by pair, in both directions each time.
`[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`

**The image and delivery route classes accept all four and require none.** On the reference an
image and a static stream answer a request carrying no token at all, so on those two classes the
mechanisms are accepted rather than demanded. That is a measurement about the reference, and what
Atrium does about it belongs to the features that own those routes — see
[behaviours §2.10](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#210-the-image-and-delivery-routes-accept-a-token-and-require-none).

**Rejection is not uniform, and the split is measured.** A request to an authenticated route with
no token or an unknown token is `401` with an empty body. A valid token whose user lacks the
required permission is `403`. **A disabled account is `403`**, not the `401` this specification
first assumed. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` The distinction is what clients branch on — they re-authenticate on
`401` and show an error on `403` — so a disabled account answered `401` loops a client through a
login it can never complete, with the user's password correct every time.

### 3.2 How a client identifies itself

`X-Emby-Authorization: MediaBrowser Client="…", Device="…", DeviceId="…", Version="…"`

**Mandatory on `POST /Users/AuthenticateByName`, and there only.** A header carrying no
`DeviceId` is served normally on every other route — measured `200`, not a refusal. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`
The `Emby` in the name is historical.

| Component | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Client` | Application name, e.g. `Jellyfin Android` |
| `Device` | Human-readable device name shown in session lists |
| `DeviceId` | Stable per-installation identifier. **This is what identifies a session** |
| `Version` | Client version string |

**The header must carry a scheme word**, and it is `MediaBrowser` or `Emby`, matched
case-insensitively. Without one — or with any other word — nothing is read out of the header at
all. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`

Parsing is lenient in some of the ways clients are sloppy and **strict in two the reference is
strict about**, and the difference was measured rather than assumed:

| Variation | Accepted |
|---|---|
| Components in any order | yes |
| Values quoted, or bare | yes |
| No space after a comma, or a space before one | yes |
| Extra spaces after the scheme, or a trailing comma | yes |
| Unknown components | yes, ignored |
| **Whitespace around the `=`** | **no** |
| **A lowercase component name** | **no** |

An earlier version of this section claimed whitespace around `=` was accepted. It is not, and
matching the reference matters more than being kind: no working client sends that form, and
accepting it would let a client be built against Atrium that fails against the reference
([behaviours §6](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#6-non-improvements)).

**The header is accepted anywhere and authenticates nobody.** Alongside a token the request
succeeds; carrying only this header and no token, an authenticated route answers `401` with the
same empty body as a request carrying nothing at all. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` It identifies a client; it
does not admit one. Atrium accepts it on any route and uses `DeviceId` to attribute the session
when present.

### 3.3 `POST /Users/AuthenticateByName` — `AuthenticateUserByName`

**Consumers:** music-client, video-client.

**Request**

| Part | Name | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| header | `X-Emby-Authorization` | yes | §3.2 |
| body | `Username` | yes | Matched case-insensitively |
| body | `Pw` | yes | May be empty when the account has no password |

**Response — 200**

```json
{
  "User": { },
  "SessionInfo": { },
  "AccessToken": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6",
  "ServerId": "3f9c1a7e5b2d4e8091a6c3f70d5e2b14"
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `User` | The full user object of §3.5 |
| `SessionInfo` | The session created by this authentication, §3.8. `LastPlaybackCheckIn` is `0001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000Z` for one that has never played anything — .NET's minimum date, not null and not absent `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` |
| `AccessToken` | 32 lowercase hex characters `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` |
| `ServerId` | The server identity from 001 §3.1 |

**Errors**

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| Unknown username | `401` `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` |
| Wrong password on an enabled account | `401` — v1's own decision; the reference's answer is unmeasured and held by §7 OQ-5 |
| **Disabled account** | **`403`** — whether the password is right or wrong `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` |
| Locked out by failed attempts | `403` — v1's own decision; the reference's answer is unmeasured and held by §7 OQ-5 |
| Missing or unparseable `X-Emby-Authorization` | `400` `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` |
| Malformed body | `400` |

**Every refusal measured above carries the same body**: 25 bytes of `text/plain`, with no charset
parameter, reading `Error processing request.` This is a third refusal shape, distinct from the
empty `401` an authenticated route sends and from the structured problem document the framework's
own validation sends. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` A malformed body is the exception and keeps that structured
shape, because it is rejected before the handler runs. The measured refusals are asserted by
comparing bytes, since they share one body and only the status tells them apart —
[behaviours §1.11](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#111-there-are-four-error-shapes-not-one).

The split is load-bearing for clients: `401` means "your credentials are wrong, ask again", `403`
means "this account cannot log in, stop asking", and any other `4xx` means "something else went
wrong, do not tell the user their password is bad". Answering `401` where the reference answers
`403` produces a login loop the user cannot escape by typing the correct password.

**Behaviour beyond the response**

1. A session is created for `(user, DeviceId, Client)`. Authenticating again from the **same
   `DeviceId`** replaces that session rather than accumulating one per login.
2. Failed attempts are counted per user. After the configured threshold the account locks and
   further attempts fail regardless of credentials. A success resets the count. **The status a
   locked-out account answers with is not measured** — measuring it means locking a real account
   on a real server, which no probe here will do to somebody's installation (§7 OQ-5). Until it
   is, Atrium answers `403`, on the argument that a locked account is in the same state a disabled
   one is: further attempts cannot succeed, and telling a client to keep asking is the failure
   mode `403` exists to prevent.
3. Passwords are never recoverable from the server's stored state, and never appear in logs — not
   at any log level, not in a request trace, not in an error message.

### 3.4 `GET /Users/Public` — `GetPublicUsers`

**Consumers:** video-client. Unauthenticated.

Returns the users the server shows on login screens: an array of **complete** §3.5 objects,
`Configuration` and `Policy` included, byte-identical to what an authenticated caller receives.
`[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`

**This section previously asserted the opposite** — that the two were omitted, "because this is
pre-authentication and it must not disclose what a user is allowed to do". The reasoning was sound
and the premise was measured to be false: the reference sends every user's full policy and
configuration to anyone who can reach the port. Atrium replicates it, and the argument, including
the case for diverging, is in
[behaviours §3.5](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#35-userspublic-discloses-every-users-policy-to-anyone--class-b-replicated).

**An empty array is a valid `200`.** Users flagged hidden from login screens are excluded, and an
installation where every user is hidden legitimately returns `[]`.
`[prior-probe: Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-06-13]`

### 3.5 The user object

Returned by §3.3, §3.4, §3.6 and §3.7.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | Sent first |
| `ServerId` | string | **Before `Id`** — the reference's order, not this table's former one `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` |
| `Id` | string | 32 hex |
| `ServerName` | string | |
| `PrimaryImageTag` | string | Present only when the user has an avatar |
| `PrimaryImageAspectRatio` | number | Same condition |
| `HasPassword` | boolean | |
| `HasConfiguredPassword` | boolean | |
| `HasConfiguredEasyPassword` | boolean | Always `false`; v1 has no PIN concept |
| `EnableAutoLogin` | boolean | |
| `LastLoginDate` | date | Absent until first login |
| `LastActivityDate` | date | |
| `Configuration` | object | §3.6. **Sent by `/Users/Public` too** |
| `Policy` | object | **Sent by `/Users/Public` too** |

`ServerName` and `PrimaryImageAspectRatio` are declared and **absent from every measured
response**, because they are null and nulls are omitted globally
([behaviours §1.7](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md)). Their position in the order is
therefore unverified: nothing can measure where a property that is never sent would sit.

`[spec: UserDto]`

**Policy in v1.** The reference sends **42** policy properties. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` v1 stores and returns the
whole set so clients see the shape they expect, but **honours fourteen of them** — eleven since it
was written, and the three playback permissions since transcoding entered v1, which is the last
row of this table and the amendment below it:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `IsAdministrator` | Reserved; v1 has no admin surface to gate |
| `IsDisabled` | Authentication answers `403` `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]` |
| `IsHidden` | Excluded from `/Users/Public` |
| `EnableAllFolders`, `EnabledFolders` | Which libraries the user sees |
| `EnableMediaPlayback` | Whether delivery routes answer |
| `EnableContentDeletion`, `EnableContentDeletionFromFolders` | Whether deletion is permitted |
| `LoginAttemptsBeforeLockout`, `InvalidLoginAttemptCount` | §3.3. The reference sends **-1** for the first, which is a sentinel and not a count `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` — see §7 OQ-6 |
| `MaxActiveSessions` | Cap on concurrent sessions; `0` means unlimited, and `0` is what the reference sends `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` |
| `EnableVideoPlaybackTranscoding`, `EnableAudioPlaybackTranscoding`, `EnablePlaybackRemuxing` | Whether the negotiation may answer this user with a transcode or a remux ([008 §3.3](../008-playback-negotiation-and-delivery/spec.md#33-the-decision)) `[spec: UserPolicy]` |

**The other 28 are stored and echoed unchanged.** **This is a known, bounded gap**, not an oversight: a
flag returned but unenforced is a delta a client could observe by testing the restriction. It is
accepted for v1 because the unenforced flags all gate features v1 does not have (Live TV, sync,
remote control) — enforcing "you may not sync" on a server that never syncs is not observable. Any
flag whose feature arrives must be enforced in the same change.

**The three transcoding flags moved into the enforced set on 2026-08-27**, when transcoding entered
v1 ([roadmap](../../docs/roadmap.md#in-scope)). That is this rule working as written rather than an
edit to it: the feature arrived, so the flags that restrict it stopped being unobservable, and a
user whose policy forbids transcoding is told the source is not playable instead of being handed
one.

### 3.6 `POST /Users/Configuration` — `UpdateUserConfiguration`

**Consumers:** video-client.

Replaces the authenticated user's configuration: audio and subtitle language preferences, subtitle
mode, whether missing episodes are displayed, view ordering and exclusions, next-episode autoplay.
`[spec: UserConfiguration]` The reference sends **16** properties in all, the rest being cast
receiver, local-password, remembered track selections, played-item hiding, collection view and
folder grouping. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`

`204` on success. `401` unauthenticated. Unknown properties are ignored, not rejected.

**v1 stores and returns every property faithfully but acts on only those that change something v1
does:** language preferences (which influence default track selection in 008) and
`DisplayMissingEpisodes` (which changes what 005 returns). The same bounded-gap reasoning as §3.5
applies.

### 3.7 `GET /Users/Me` and `GET /Users/{userId}`

**Consumers:** video-client (`Me`), music-client (`{userId}`).

Both return the §3.5 object in full, including configuration and policy.

**`GET /Users/{userId}` refuses no authenticated caller.** Any caller carrying a usable token is
answered `200` with the named user's whole §3.5 object — a non-administrator naming another
non-administrator, a restricted non-administrator naming an **administrator**, an administrator
naming anybody, and a user naming themselves are one answer, and the bytes do not depend on who
asked: the administrator's object as read by a restricted stranger is byte-identical to that
administrator's own reading of it.
`[probe: tools/probe_user_read.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-09-01]`

| The request | The answer |
|---|---|
| Any authenticated caller, any existing `userId` | `200`, the whole §3.5 object, `Configuration` and `Policy` included |
| A `userId` that is well formed and belongs to nobody | `404`, the message as a JSON-encoded bare string: `"User not found"`, 16 bytes, `application/json; charset=utf-8`. **The same body to an administrator and to a non-administrator** |
| A `userId` that is not an identifier at all | `400`, the model binder's validation body, keyed on the parameter's own spelling: `{"userId": ["The value 'not-an-identifier' is not valid."]}` |
| No credential at all | `401`, empty, as everywhere else |

`[probe: tools/probe_user_read.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-09-01]`

> **This section asserted a `403` for a non-administrator reading anybody else, from the day 002
> was written until 2026-09-01, with no provenance.** 009 T2 measured one cell of it on 2026-08-31

> this project answers
> ([behaviours §1.11](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#111-there-are-four-error-shapes-not-one)).

### 3.8 Sessions

A session is a `(user, device, client)` triple, created at authentication and identified by the
`DeviceId` of §3.2.

**`POST /Sessions/Capabilities/Full` — `PostFullCapabilities`.** Included by design; clients post
their playable media types, supported commands and device profile after logging in. v1 stores the
declaration and reflects it in §3.9. It does not act on `SupportedCommands`, because v1 has no
remote control — but a client that posts capabilities and then sees them missing from `/Sessions`
has observed a difference, which is why storing it is not optional.

**`GET /Sessions` — `GetSessions`.** Returns the sessions the caller may see: their own always, and
all sessions for an administrator. Each carries the identity fields (`Id`, `UserId`, `UserName`,
`Client`, `DeviceId`, `DeviceName`, `ApplicationVersion`, `RemoteEndPoint`), activity timestamps,
the declared capabilities, and — while something is playing — `NowPlayingItem` and `PlayState`,
which feature 007 populates. `[spec: SessionInfoDto]`

**`POST /Sessions/Capabilities/Full` answers `204` with no body, and replaces rather than merges.**
An unknown property is accepted — the `204` — and **dropped from the session's `Capabilities`**;
Atrium keeps it, which is a recorded divergence and not parity
([behaviours §5.9](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#59-an-unknown-capabilities-property-survives-into-sessions-here-and-not-there)).
*(This section said "the reference keeps it too" until the 2026-08-28 run read the echo back:
the 2026-08-26 measurement saw only the `204`.)*
`[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`

`SupportsMediaControl` and `SupportsRemoteControl` are `false` in v1. This was argued as honest
rather than a gap — a client that saw `true` would offer a remote-control UI that does nothing —
and it is now **measured to be no divergence at all**: the reference reports `false` at the top
level for a session that posted `SupportsMediaControl: true`, while echoing that `true` back inside
`Capabilities`. `[probe: tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]` The declaration is the client's; the flag is the server's
judgement about it. `PlayableMediaTypes` and `SupportedCommands` *are* hoisted from the declaration
verbatim.

**Lifecycle**

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| Authentication from a known `DeviceId` | Existing session is replaced, its token invalidated |
| Any authenticated request | `LastActivityDate` advances |
| Playback reporting (007) | `LastPlaybackCheckIn` advances |
| Inactivity beyond the configured window | Session and token expire; next request is `401` |
| `MaxActiveSessions` exceeded | Oldest session is evicted |

> ⚠️ **OQ-2.** The reference's inactivity window and whether it is observable to a client. If a
> client caches a token for weeks and Atrium expires it sooner, users see spurious logouts. Until
> measured, v1 does not expire tokens on inactivity at all — the safe direction, since a token that
> outlives the reference's is invisible to a client, whereas one that dies sooner is not.

## 4. Data the feature owns

| State | Observable as | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| User accounts | `/Users/*` responses | Until removed by an operator |
| Password verifier | `HasPassword`, and whether authentication succeeds | With the account |
| Failed-attempt counter | `InvalidLoginAttemptCount`; lockout behaviour | Reset on success |
| Access tokens | Whether a request is `401` | Until replaced, evicted or revoked |
| Sessions | `/Sessions` responses | See §3.8 |
| Per-user configuration | `Configuration` in §3.5 | Until replaced |

## 5. Acceptance criteria

1. Authenticating with valid credentials answers `200` with a 32-hex `AccessToken`, a full user
   object and a session.
2. An unknown username answers `401`; a **disabled account answers `403`**; a missing
   `X-Emby-Authorization` answers `400`. All three carry the reference's `text/plain` body, byte
   for byte, and are asserted as bytes rather than as status codes.
3. All **five** token mechanisms of §3.1 authenticate the same request identically on an API
   route, and a request carrying two resolves in the measured order:
   `Authorization` > `X-Emby-Authorization` > `X-Emby-Token` > query. On the image and delivery
   route classes all five are **accepted and none is required**, which is what the reference does —
   the criterion there is that presenting a token is never itself a reason to refuse.
4. No token on an authenticated route is `401`; a valid token lacking permission is `403`.
5. Re-authenticating from the same `DeviceId` replaces the session and invalidates the prior token.
6. `/Users/Public` answers without a token, excludes hidden users, and answers `200` with `[]`
   when all users are hidden. It carries the **whole** user object — `Configuration` and `Policy`
   included — because the reference does; this criterion asserted the opposite until it was
   measured.
7. `GET /Users/{userId}` answers **`200` with the named user's whole object to every authenticated
   caller** — a non-administrator naming another non-administrator, a non-administrator naming an
   administrator, an administrator naming anybody, and a user naming themselves alike — with
   `Configuration` and `Policy` included and the same bytes whoever asked. An identifier no account
   has is `404` carrying `"User not found"`; a malformed one is the validation `400` keyed on
   `userId`; no credential is the empty `401`. **This criterion asserted a `403` for a
   non-administrator until the route was measured on 2026-09-01**, and it was the last thing in
   this document still describing a refusal §3.7 had already withdrawn.
8. `POST /Users/Configuration` round-trips every property, including ones v1 does not act on.
9. Capabilities posted to `/Sessions/Capabilities/Full` appear in the caller's `/Sessions` entry.
10. After `LoginAttemptsBeforeLockout` failures the account answers **`403`** even with correct
    credentials, and one success afterwards resets the counter. `403` rather than `401` for the
    same reason a disabled account does — the reference's own answer here is unmeasured (§7, OQ-5),
    and this criterion said `401` until §3.3 was corrected and the two drifted apart.
11. A password never appears in any log record at any level, and never in an error body.
12. `GET /Users/Me` returns the caller's §3.5 object in full, configuration and policy included.
    *(Added at the 2026-08-28 audit — M30: the route was implemented and golden-tested with no
    criterion naming it.)*
13. The session lifecycle is observable: exceeding `MaxActiveSessions` evicts the least recently
    used session and its token; an authenticated request advances `LastActivityDate`, written at
    the next flush; and `POST /Sessions/Capabilities/Full` answers `204` with no body and
    **replaces** the previous set rather than merging into it (§3.8). *(Added at the same
    audit — M29.)*

## 6. Conformance

| Endpoint | Level | How it is proven |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /Users/AuthenticateByName` | **L3** | Golden response plus differential. Everything downstream depends on this being byte-right. **L2 is met; the differential half needs the harness [010](../010-conformance-harness/spec.md) delivers and a reachable reference server, so the gap is recorded rather than counted as met** |
| `GET /Users/Public` | **L2** | Golden response; fixture with a hidden user |
| `GET /Users/Me`, `GET /Users/{userId}` | **L2** | Golden response, plus the caller matrix — every pair of caller and subject, the identifier nobody has, the malformed one and the absent credential. It was a *permission* matrix until 2026-09-01; there are no permissions on this route to tabulate, so what it proves is that no caller is refused and no body is redacted |
| `POST /Users/Configuration` | **L2** | Round-trip test |
| `GET /Sessions` | **L2** | Fixture with two sessions on two devices |
| `POST /Sessions/Capabilities/Full` | **L1** | Shape only; its effect is asserted through `/Sessions` |
| The five token mechanisms | **L2** | Table-driven across three route classes, including the precedence pairs and the grammar table (AC-3) |

## 7. Open questions

| # | Question | Blocks | Resolved by |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-2 | The reference's token inactivity window, and whether it is observable | The expiry row of §3.8. v1 defaults to no inactivity expiry | A probe holding a token idle |
| OQ-4 | Are `HasConfiguredPassword` and `HasConfiguredEasyPassword` read by any client? | Nothing; honest values are sent | Differential harness (010) |
| OQ-6 | What `LoginAttemptsBeforeLockout = -1` means. It is what the reference sends, so it is what most accounts carry, and it is a sentinel rather than a threshold | §3.3's lockout rule, which reads it as a count | A probe against a throwaway account, alongside OQ-5 |
| OQ-5 | The refusals a probe will not send at a real installation: an enabled account given a **wrong password**, an account **locked out** by failed attempts, and a **live token whose user was disabled** after it was issued | The two rows §3.3 states as v1's own decision, and the `403` v1 answers a locked-out account with | `tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py` against a **throwaway enabled, non-administrator** account somebody is willing to lock |

> **Narrowed on 2026-09-01.** This row also held a **`403` for insufficient permission** and the **shape** of both `403`s, on the premise that *"the account available to measure with is an administrator, and an administrator lacks no permission"*. That premise stopped being true: three probes now create and delete throwaway non-administrators, and the shape is measured rather than analogised. A controller's own refusal is `text/plain` with no charset and 25 bytes; an authorization **policy**'s refusal has no body and no content type `[probe: tools/probe_playlist_visibility.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-31]`. So the sentence *"which v1 sends empty by analogy with the measured empty `401`"* described code that no longer exists — `ForbiddenError` has answered the 25 bytes since 009 T2, and the empty shape is a second class. What remains open is the three refusals above, which still cost somebody's account a lockout counter to measure; [behaviours §1.11](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#111-there-are-four-error-shapes-not-one) carries the shapes that were settled.

**Why OQ-5 is not simply measured.** Each of them needs a real account to fail against, and
failing against one moves a lockout counter that no probe can reset — on somebody's own server, for
an account somebody uses. The probe measures the refusals that cost nothing (an unknown username
cannot be locked out, and an account already disabled cannot be locked further) and declines the
rest by design rather than by omission.

### Resolved

| # | Question | Answer | Resolved by |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Is `X-Emby-Authorization` accepted outside authentication, and does it change behaviour alongside a token? | **Accepted anywhere, authenticates nobody.** Alongside a token the request succeeds; alone it is the same empty `401` as no header at all. §3.2 rewritten | `tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py`, 2026-08-26 |
| OQ-3 | Does the reference answer `401` or `403` for a disabled user? §3.3 assumed `401` | **Contradicted: `403`**, and distinguishable from the `401` an unknown username gets — the opposite of the "indistinguishable on purpose" this specification asserted. §3.1, §3.3, §3.5 and AC-2 corrected, and the reasoning is in [behaviours §2.11](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#211-a-disabled-account-is-refused-with-403-not-401) | `tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py`, 2026-08-26 |
| — | Which mechanism wins when a request carries two that disagree? Not asked; the plan called the order arbitrary | **`Authorization` > `X-Emby-Token` > query.** [plan §6.1](plan.md#61-token-extraction) had fixed the opposite order | `tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py`, 2026-08-26 |
| — | Do the image and delivery route classes require a token? Assumed yes by AC-3 | **No — both answer `200` with no token at all.** AC-3 corrected; what Atrium does about it is deferred to 006 and 008, [behaviours §2.10](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#210-the-image-and-delivery-routes-accept-a-token-and-require-none) | `tools/probe_auth_mechanisms.py`, 2026-08-26 |
