# 001 — Server identity and discovery

> **This document describes WHAT and WHY only.** No technology names, no storage decisions.

## 1. Purpose

Every client's first request is "is there a server here, and what is it?". This feature answers it.

It is first not because it is large — it is the smallest feature in v1 — but because it is the
first thing that can be wrong, and because it forces the wire-format decisions (property casing,
version string, identifier shape, the meaning of `ProductName`) that everything else will encode.
A client that mis-identifies the server here takes an unknown-server path and never reaches the
rest of the API.

**Client behaviour unlocked:** entering a server address in a client and getting "connected to
<name>" instead of "cannot find a server".

## 2. Scope

**In scope**

- `GET /System/Info/Public` — unauthenticated identity.
- `GET /System/Info` — authenticated, fuller identity.
- `GET /System/Ping` and `POST /System/Ping` — liveness.
- The rules for choosing the advertised address.
- The project-wide wire-format rules that these responses are the first to exercise.

**Out of scope**

- `GET /Users/Public` — the login-screen user list, which belongs with authentication (002).
- `GET /Localization/Cultures` — belongs with item metadata (004).
- `/System/Info/Storage`, `/System/Restart`, `/System/Shutdown`, `/System/Logs`,
  `/System/Endpoint` — administrative surface, not in v1.
- UDP autodiscovery on the local network — not in v1; clients take an address.

## 3. Behaviour

### 3.0 Rules that apply to every response in this specification

These are stated once here and inherited by every later specification. They come from
[behaviours.md §1](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#1-wire-format).

1. **Property names are PascalCase.** Non-negotiable, project-wide.
2. **Content type is `application/json`.** The server additionally accepts requests specifying
   `application/json; profile="PascalCase"` or `profile="CamelCase"`. Those are three names for
   **two** behaviours, not three names for one: the plain type and the PascalCase profile answer
   identically, the CamelCase profile answers with camelCase property names **at every depth**, and
   the response's content type echoes the profile that matched, before the charset.
   `[probe: tools/probe_content_type_profiles.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]`

   Three details decide whether a reimplementation is right, and none are in the reference's
   published contract:

   - the profile is matched leniently on the media type's parameter — unquoted and in any casing —
     but **a charset parameter beside it stops the match**, and an unknown profile falls back;
   - ranking is ordinary content negotiation: equal quality keeps the client's order;
   - **dictionary keys are never converted.** Only property names are, which is why the conversion
     happens where a field is still a field.

   The conversion itself is the reference's own naming policy rather than "lower the first letter":
   a leading run of capitals lowers all but the last of them, so `UICulture` becomes `uiCulture`.
3. **Absent optional values are omitted or null exactly as the reference server does**, verified per
   field rather than by rule.
4. **Identifiers are 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters**, no dashes.

### 3.1 `GET /System/Info/Public` — `GetPublicSystemInfo`

**Consumers:** music-client, video-client. The single most important response in the API: it is what
a multi-server client uses to decide which dialect it is speaking.

**Request:** no authentication, no parameters. Must answer before any user exists and before any
library is configured.

**Response — 200**

```json
{
  "LocalAddress": "http://192.168.1.20:8096",
  "ServerName": "atrium",
  "Version": "10.11.11",
  "ProductName": "Jellyfin Server",
  "OperatingSystem": "",
  "Id": "3f9c1a7e5b2d4e8091a6c3f70d5e2b14",
  "StartupWizardCompleted": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `LocalAddress` | string | The address this server advertises for the requester's network. §3.4 |
| `ServerName` | string | Operator-chosen friendly name. Default `atrium` |
| `Version` | string | `10.11.11` — the pinned reference version, not Atrium's own |
| `ProductName` | string | **Exactly `Jellyfin Server`** |
| `OperatingSystem` | string | **Always the empty string** |
| `Id` | string | Stable 32-hex server identity, generated once and persisted |
| `StartupWizardCompleted` | boolean | Whether initial setup is finished |

**Compatibility notes**

- `ProductName` is the documented discriminator multi-server clients use to tell Emby from
  Jellyfin. It must be the literal `Jellyfin Server`. The reasoning, and why this does not conflict
  with being honest about what Atrium is, is in
  [reference-target.md §4](../../docs/compatibility/reference-target.md#4-server-identity-what-atrium-tells-clients-it-is).
  `[probe: tools/probe_public_info.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-28]`
- `OperatingSystem` is empty because the reference implementation marks the field obsolete and
  never assigns it, leaving its default empty-string value.
  `[source: MediaBrowser.Model/System/PublicSystemInfo.cs:37-38 @ v10.11.11]`
- The reference builds this response from exactly six assignments and never sets
  `OperatingSystem`. Atrium sends the same seven fields and no others.
  `[source: Emby.Server.Implementations/SystemManager.cs:112-125 @ v10.11.11]`
- `Id` must survive restarts and database rebuilds. A server whose identity changes makes every
  client treat it as a new server and re-authenticate.

**Errors**

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| Server still starting | `503`; see §3.5 |

### 3.2 `GET /System/Info` — `GetSystemInfo`

**Consumers:** music-client.

**Request:** authenticated. The reference also permits this during first-time setup, before any
user exists.
`[source: Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/SystemController.cs:67-71 @ v10.11.11]`

**Response — 200:** a superset of §3.1. In addition to the seven public fields, the reference
returns paths, capability flags and update state.
`[spec: SystemInfo]`

Atrium returns the superset with these values:

| Field group | Atrium's answer |
|---|---|
| `HasPendingRestart`, `IsShuttingDown`, `CanSelfRestart`, `CanLaunchWebBrowser`, `HasUpdateAvailable` | `false` — Atrium has no self-update or restart capability |
| `SupportsLibraryMonitor` | `false` in v1 — filesystem watching is not implemented |
| `WebSocketPortNumber` | The server's own port; v1 serves no WebSocket, but the field is a number clients read unconditionally |
| `ProgramDataPath`, `CachePath`, `LogPath`, `InternalMetadataPath`, `ItemsByNamePath`, `TranscodingTempPath`, `WebPath` | Real paths from the running configuration |
| `CompletedInstallations`, `CastReceiverApplications` | Empty arrays |
| `PackageName`, `OperatingSystemDisplayName`, `SystemArchitecture`, `EncoderLocation` | Real values where meaningful, empty string otherwise |

> ⚠️ **Open question OQ-1.** Whether any client branches on `SupportsLibraryMonitor` or
> `WebSocketPortNumber`. Neither analysed client reads them. Answering it needs the differential
> harness (010) or a survey of other clients. It does not block this feature: the fields are sent
> with honest values either way.

**Errors**

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| No or invalid token, and setup already complete | `401` |
| Valid token without permission | `403` |

### 3.3 `GET /System/Ping`, `POST /System/Ping` — `GetPingSystem`, `PostPingSystem`

**Consumers:** none of the two analysed clients; included by design (health checks, reverse proxies,
and clients that probe before a full request).

**Request:** no authentication, no parameters, both methods.

**Response — 200:** a bare JSON string — **the product name, not the friendly server name**:

```json
"Jellyfin Server"
```

**Compatibility note.** The reference's documentation comment says "the server name", but the code
returns the application's product name.
`[source: Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/SystemController.cs:102-106 @ v10.11.11, returning
_appHost.Name; ApplicationHost.cs:260 defines Name => ApplicationProductName]`
Following the comment instead of the code would return the operator's chosen name and produce a
delta. **The code is the specification.**

### 3.4 Choosing `LocalAddress`

The reference resolves this in three tiers, and the tiers are observable, so Atrium reproduces
them. `[source: Emby.Server.Implementations/ApplicationHost.cs:871-949 @ v10.11.11]`

1. **A configured published URL wins**, returned verbatim with any trailing `/` removed. This is
   what an operator behind a reverse proxy sets, and it must not be second-guessed.
2. **Otherwise, if configured to derive the address from the request**, build it from the request's
   own host and scheme, omitting the port when it is the default for that scheme (80/http,
   443/https).
3. **Otherwise, match the requester's address against the server's bound addresses** and return the
   one on the same network, with the port it is bound to. A request arriving over a VPN gets the
   VPN-side address.

**Deliberate divergence.** In tier 3 the reference overrides the scheme to HTTPS, with the HTTPS
port, whenever a certificate is configured — regardless of the scheme the request arrived on. This
has a measured cost: clients that hand this address to a device with no TLS stack (a DLNA renderer)
break. `[probe: tools/probe_local_address.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-09-02]`

**Atrium reports the scheme and port the server is actually reachable on for that network.** Logged
as a deliberate divergence in
[behaviours.md §4.2](../../docs/compatibility/behaviours.md#42-localaddress-does-not-get-an-https-override).

### 3.5 What the server says while it is starting

Not an error path of one endpoint but a property of the whole server: **every operation the
reference declares declares a `503`**, so nothing is exempt — not even a liveness probe. Re-measured
against the pinned document on 2026-09-01: 389 of 389, every one carrying exactly `Retry-After` and
`Message` and a `text/html` body. The count is a property of *that server* rather than of Jellyfin —
an installed plugin adds operations, which is how the 395 recorded on 2026-08-26 was reached — so
the claim is the coverage, not the number.
`[spec: every operation's 503 response in the pinned 10.11.11 document]`

**Response — 503**

| Part | Value |
|---|---|
| `Retry-After` | Full seconds, as an integer. Not an HTTP-date |
| `Message` | A short plain-text reason |
| Body | `text/html` — **not** JSON |

`Retry-After` is what separates "starting" from "broken" for a client. Without it a `503` is
indistinguishable from a server that is down, and a client that cannot tell will either give up or
hammer.

The same response serves a deliberate withdrawal from service — a long rebuild, say — with a
different message and a longer hint, without stopping the process.

> The `503` responses are also where the reference's OpenAPI document declares `allowEmptyValue`
> on header objects, which is invalid there and makes strict parsers reject the whole document. See
> [reference-target.md §2](../../docs/compatibility/reference-target.md#2-sources-of-truth-in-precedence-order).

### 3.6 How a request is matched to a route

Every path in this repository is written in one canonical spelling, and that is not the only
spelling that reaches the route. Like §3.5, this is a property of the whole server rather than of
one endpoint, and it is stated here because 001 is the feature that first has routes to match.
`[probe: tools/probe_routing.py, Jellyfin 10.11.11, 2026-08-26]`

| A client sends | Answer |
|---|---|
| The canonical spelling | The route |
| Any other casing — `/system/info/public`, `/SYSTEM/INFO/PUBLIC` | The same route, the same bytes |
| One trailing slash | The same route, the same bytes. **Not** a redirect |
| Two trailing slashes | `404` |
| A path matching no route | `404`, empty body, no content type |
| A method the path does not have | `405`, empty body, no content type, and an `Allow` header |

**`Allow` lists every method the path has**, which is not the same as every method the matched
route has: a path served by two routes — `GET` and `POST` on the same path — advertises both.

**Nothing is automatic.** `HEAD` on a path that has only `GET` is a `405`, and so is `OPTIONS`.
Answering either would be a difference on every route at once, which is the kind of default worth
turning off deliberately rather than inheriting.

Path **parameters** are values, not spellings: only the segments a route declares literally are
matched case-insensitively, and whatever occupies a parameter reaches the handler exactly as the
client wrote it.

## 4. Data the feature owns

Observable, and surviving restart:

| State | Observable as | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Server identity | `Id` in §3.1 and §3.2 | Generated once on first start; never changes |
| Friendly name | `ServerName` | Operator-configurable |
| Setup completion | `StartupWizardCompleted` | Set once initial configuration is done |

Everything else in these responses is derived at request time.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

1. `GET /System/Info/Public` answers `200` with exactly the seven fields of §3.1, in PascalCase,
   with no user configured and no library present.
2. `ProductName` is exactly `Jellyfin Server` and `OperatingSystem` is exactly `""`.
3. `Version` matches the pinned reference version.
4. `Id` is 32 lowercase hex characters and is **identical across a restart and across a rebuild of
   the store from empty**.
5. `GET /System/Info` answers `401` without a token and `200` with a valid one, and its body is a
   superset of `/System/Info/Public` agreeing on every shared field.
6. `GET /System/Ping` and `POST /System/Ping` both answer `200` with the JSON string
   `"Jellyfin Server"`.
7. A configured published URL is returned verbatim in `LocalAddress`, trailing slash removed.
8. With no published URL, two requests from two different networks receive two different
   `LocalAddress` values, each on the requester's network.
9. Requests sent with `Accept: application/json` and with `application/json; profile="PascalCase"`
   receive byte-identical bodies. A request sent with `profile="CamelCase"` receives the same
   values under camelCase property names, and every response says in its own content type which of
   the two it used.
10. No response in this feature contains a property name that is not PascalCase.
11. A path spelled in any casing, with or without one trailing slash, reaches the same route and
    returns the same bytes; two trailing slashes do not. A path matching no route and a method a
    path does not have are both refused with an empty body, and the second carries an `Allow`
    header naming **every** method that path has.
12. While the server is starting, **every** route answers `503` with `Retry-After` in full
    integer seconds, a `Message` header saying why, and a `text/html` body — never JSON (§3.5).
    *(Added at the 2026-08-28 audit — M27: the whole of §3.5 was implemented and tested with no
    criterion covering it.)*
13. With no published URL and the server configured to derive the address from the request, the
    request's own host and scheme come back in `LocalAddress`, with the port omitted when it is
    the scheme's default (§3.4 tier 2). *(Added at the same audit — M28.)*

## 6. Conformance

| Endpoint | Level | How it is proven |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /System/Info/Public` | **L3** | Golden response, plus differential against a real reference server. It is the first request every client makes; a difference here costs everything downstream |
| `GET /System/Info` | **L2** | Golden response and the superset assertion of AC-5 |
| `GET /System/Ping` (both methods) | **L2** | Exact-body test |
| `LocalAddress` selection | **L2** | Table-driven test over the three tiers with synthesised requester addresses |
| Path matching and refusals (§3.6) | **L0** | Every route registered against `surface.yaml` and none outside it; the accepted spellings; the empty `404` and `405` |

The two cross-cutting sweeps described in
[conformance.md](../../docs/compatibility/conformance.md#l1--shape) — PascalCase over every
response model, and units over every `*Ticks` and `*Date` field — are **delivered by this feature**,
because it is the first one with a response model to sweep.

**L3 for `/System/Info/Public` is not met, and is deferred rather than skipped.** Its second half —
the same request issued to Atrium and to a real reference server, compared field by field — needs
the differential harness that [feature 010](../010-conformance-harness/spec.md) delivers, and that
harness needs a reachable Jellyfin, which no gate in this repository is allowed to depend on. What
is met now is **L2**: a byte-compared golden response, every field's value asserted, and the
measurements behind them recorded with provenance. The gap closes the first time 010 runs, and the
`LocalAddress` row of its allowlist is already written.

## 7. Open questions

| # | Question | Blocks | Resolved by |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Does any real client branch on `SupportsLibraryMonitor` or `WebSocketPortNumber`? | Nothing. Honest values are sent either way | Differential harness (010), or surveying additional clients |
| OQ-3 | Is `StartupWizardCompleted` meaningful for Atrium, which has no wizard? | Nothing; `true` after first configuration | A decision in 002, where user creation happens |
| OQ-4 | Whether a running reference actually emits both headers, or only declares them | Nothing; both are sent | `tools/probe_startup.py`, which has to catch a server mid-start |

### Resolved

| # | Question | Answer | Resolved by |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-2 | Does the reference emit `503` with `Retry-After` while starting? | **Yes, and it is server-wide** — all 395 operations declare it, with `Retry-After` **and** a `Message` header, and a `text/html` body. §3.5 records it; §3.1's one-line error row was incomplete | The pinned document, 2026-08-26 |
